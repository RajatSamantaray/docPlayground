Sleuth
=======
1)Add dependency
spring-cloud-starter-sleuth
Zipkin
=======
Sleuth generates the traceId and spanId.
But it is difficult to make use of that data in its raw form. This is where Zipkin is used.
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system which allows us to gather information on the trace of a request.
By adding appropriate dependency, we make sleuth send all its details to a Zipkin server. 
The Zipkin server has an in memory DB where the details are stored.
Zipkin has a powerful UI application, which allows to analyse the logs and take appropriate action.
STEPS
=====
1)Create a project with zipkinconfig

2)add the below dependencies://zipkin-server,zipkin-autoconfigure-ui

<dependency>
<groupId>io.zipkin.java</groupId>
<artifactId>zipkin-autoconfigure-ui</artifactId>
<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>io.zipkin.java</groupId>
<artifactId>zipkin-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
3)Add the @EnableZipkinServer annotation to the Main class
4)Configure zipkin to run in port 9411
5) ALl MS add //spring-cloud-starter-zipkin
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
