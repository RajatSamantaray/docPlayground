Monolithic Approach - Limitations
1) Large codebase, no restriction on size
2) Longer development time
3)Challenging deployment
4)Fixed technology stack
5)Tight coupling among modules and services
6)Failure in part of system could affect entire system
7)Scaling is complex
8)Single service on server
9)Minor change requires complete rebuild
-----------------------------
microservice 
It is an architectural style
used for developing a single application as a suite of small services.
microservices 
-may be written in different programming languages 
-can use different data storage technologies.
-can independently deployable
-each running in its own process 
-communicating with lightweight mechanisms(an HTTP resource API.
Microservices
1)Atomic
-------
->Each Service will do a specific, atomic action or set of actions
->Each Service runs in its own process
->Communicate with light weight  mechanisms (Like HTTP)

2)Collaborative
------------
->Bare Minimum of Centralized Management of services
->No Central Command and Control

3)Independent and focuced
-----------------
->Can be written in different programming languages

->Are independently deployable

->Each service has its own data storage

->Do One thing and do that thing well – Single Responsibility Principle
----------
decentralized governance
