Ribbon is typically used along with Eureka.

Instead of static list, we can get a dynamic list of servers by using it with Eureka.
When used with Eureka, not only will Ribbon get the server list, but also will depend on the Eureka to know if a service is up or not.

Steps:
1)Remove Autowire of DiscoverClient and Autowire load balanced RestTemplate
2)Remove code for getting URI from discovery client
3)Access the PlanMS and FriendMS through rest template object and use the names of the service instead of the URI. 
Since Eureka is used, the URI will be picked automatically based on the service name.

PlanDTO planDTO=template.getForObject("http://PLANMS"+"/plans/"+custDTO.getCurrentPlan().getPlanId(), PlanDTO.class); 
List<Long> friends=template.getForObject("http://FRIENDFAMILYMS"+"/customers/"+phoneNo+"/friends", List.class); 
=====================
Eureka is rarely run as a single instance, as it would become a single point of failure. 
Typically we run multiple instances of Eureka forming a cluster. 
In a cluster, each Eureka server replicates the information in the other servers.
